[Scalable Vector Graphics(SVG)][1] is a popular digital image file format with optimized characteristics. SVG graphics are scalable, programmable, and capable of powerful animations. In addition, SVG images are based on vector files that accumulate images as a set of points and their connections with one another. On the other side, [PDF][2] is another enterprise-level vector-graphic format. It is widely used in the corporate sector due to its security, compression, and other vigorous features. In this blog post, we will go through how to **convert SVG to PDF programmatically in a Java-based application**.

We will cover the following points in this article:

In this section, we will go through the code snippet of **Java SVG to PDF conversion library.**

Following are the steps to convert SVG to PDF using the Java library:

  1. Initialize an object of the [SVGDocument][7] class with the source SVG file.
  2. Create an object of [pdfSaveOptions][8] class to access advance methods related to document [setJpegQuality][9], [setImageCompression][10] etc.
  3. Call this [setJpegQuality(int value)][9] method to specify the quality of JPEG compression for images.
  4. Invoke [convertSVG(SVGDocument document, PdfSaveOptions options, java.util.Collection providedInputStreams)][11] to convert SVG image to PDF file.

Now, copy and paste the following code snippet to convert SVG to PDF programmatically.
